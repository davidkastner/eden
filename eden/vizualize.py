    A place to save parameters for features we have already set up.

    Once they have been added you are set, 
    just update the feature you want to plot at the end of vizualize.py.

    Parameters
    ----------
    feature : str
        The column name of the feature you would like to color the plot.

    Creates a choropleth map of the US by a geographical feature using Plotly.

    The function needs to know the "feature" you would like plotted,
    and whether you want to plot by county ("Fips") or state.
    Currently only works by county.
    By default, it will look in all.csv for the feature but that can be changed.
    The min value is assumed to be zero.

    Parameters
    ----------
    feature : str
        The column name of the feature you would like to color the plot.
    units : str
        The units that you would like to appear in the plot.
    min : str
        The smallest value.
    max : str
        The max value assigned on the map. Not likely the true max.
        It should be a high value but not too high if the data is "skewed" or "fattailed".
