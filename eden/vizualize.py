    """
    Creates a choropleth map of the US by a geographical feature using Plotly.

    The function needs to know the "feature" you would like plotted,
    and whether you want to plot by county ("Fips") or state.
    Currently only works by county.
    By default, it will look in all.csv for the feature but that can be changed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    feature : str
        The column name of the feature you would like to color the plot.
    county : str
        Merge the data by County or State.
    csv : str
        The file name containing the data to be plotted.
