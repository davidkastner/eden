## Summary
There are two main files: all.csv and base.csv.
all.csv contains all the current data with all columns.
base.csv has only the key identfiers.
Most of the time you will be working with all.csv.
However, if your algorithm performance decreases with dataframe size,
and you only need geographical identifiers, you should use base.csv.
